I'm your friendly movie-buff assistant. Ask me anything about films, directors, actors - I've got the scoop on thousands of movies.

Try these questions to get started:

- When did The Matrix release?
- What are the top 5 movies of 2019 by meta score?
- Top comedy movies between 2010-2020 by IMDB rating?
- Top horror movies with a meta score above 85
- Which directors have made multiple movies that earned over 500M?
- Tell me about Steven Spielberg's best sci-fi films

What movie stuff are you curious about today?"""

    Hey! This app lets you chat about movies in the IMDB database.
    
    **Cool features:**
    - Ask about specific movies, directors, or actors
    - Filter by year, rating, genre - whatever you want
    - Get ranked lists of top movies
    - Deep dive into directors' filmographies
    
    Under the hood, I'm using vector search to find relevant movies and AI to craft helpful answers.
